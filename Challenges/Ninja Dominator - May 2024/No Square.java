/*
Problem statement
You are given an array 'A' of length 'N' ('A[i]' <= 'M'). You have to split 'A' into the minimum number of the continuous subarrays, such that in each subarray there are no two numbers whose product is a perfect square.

Return the minimum possible number of continuous subarrays that satisfies the condition and we can split 'A' in those.

For Example:-
Let 'N' = 5, 'M' = 8, 'A' = [2, 8, 1, 3, 4].
We can split 'A' in [2], [8, 1], [3, 4].
Our answer is 3.
