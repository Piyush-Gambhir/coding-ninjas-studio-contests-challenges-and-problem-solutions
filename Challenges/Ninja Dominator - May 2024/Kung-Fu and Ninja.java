Problem statement
Ninja is at a Kung-Fu restaurant. He has 'T' minutes to order the dishes of his choice. The restaurant offers ‘N’ kinds of dishes. It takes 'A[i]'​ minutes to eat the ith dish, whose deliciousness is 'B[i]'​.

The Kung-Fu restaurant has the following rules:

1. You can only order one dish at a time. The dish ordered will be immediately served and ready to eat.
2. You cannot order the same kind of dish more than once.
3. Until you finish eating the dish already served, you cannot order a new dish.
4. After 'T ' − 0.5 minutes from ordering the first order, you can no longer place a new order, but you can continue eating the dish already served.
Let Ninja's happiness be the sum of the deliciousness of the dishes he eats in this restaurant.

What is the maximum possible happiness achieved by making optimal choices?

EXAMPLE:
Input: 'N' = 3 (Number of dishes) and 'T' = 20 (Time allocated to you for ordering dishes) and ‘ARR’ = [{10, 5}, {20, 20}, {10, 50}] (Here first element in the pair is time taken to finish dish ‘i’ and second element is deliciousness of the dish)
Output: 70
Explanation: Dish 3 is ordered first, and after finishing it we will order Dish 2. Thus, total deliciousness is 20 + 50 = 70.
