Problem statement
You are given an array 'A' of length 'N', which contains the score of the students. The principal will be going through the scores of these students and will become happy if the score of a student is higher than the score of the previous student.



Your task is to rearrange the scores of the students in array 'A' such that the number of times the principal becomes happy is maximized.



Return the maximum number of times the principal will become happy provided you arrange the array 'A' optimally.



Hint:
A strictly increasing array would maximize the principal's happiness.
How can you rearrange an array with duplicates?
For Example:-
Let 'N' = 5, 'A' = [2, 1, 5, 3, 4].
You can rearrange 'A' as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The principal becomes happy at indexes 2, 3, 4, and 5 (1-based indexing).
So the answer is 4.
